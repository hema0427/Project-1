              "'[\" The ultimate HTML and css series will teach you all the skills you need to build fast and beautiful websites that look great on all kinds of devices . In the first part of this series we\\'re going to talk about the fundamentals of web development with   the second part we\\'ll explore the advanced concepts and in the third part we will put everything together and build a beautiful responsive and blazingly fast website for an imaginary cloud hosting company .\", \" i\\'m going to use vs code along with a few extensions for starting a web server and formatting our code . i\\'m welcome to use your favorite code editor if you know what you\\'re doing but otherwise head over to code.visualstudio.com and download the latest version of vs code .\", \" We\\'re going to start our web development journey here in every section you will learn something new about web development . By the end of this course you will put all of this together to build a beautiful web page . i encourage you to use the same browser so you can easily follow the course .\", \\' The course is your first step towards becoming a web developer so let me give you a simple roadmap to know where you are and where you should go next . Every website has two parts a front end and a backhand the front end is the part that you see in your browser and interact with all the visual aspects .\\', \" d back-end development front-end developers use html css and javascript to build front-ends . Back-end developer has different sets of tools available to them which is outside the scope of this course so let\\'s talk about  css css is short for cascading stylesheet . javascript is used for adding functionality to web pages .\", \\' javascript is a programming language while html and css are not meaning we cannot use them to tell computers what to do so we use css to define the look of our web pages . javascript comes in with javascript we can add functionality or behavior to web pages for example we can like your tweet .\\', \\' The better you learn and understand these languages and their features the better you will be at front-end development . The best way to learn these languages is to learn HTML and css, which are building blocks of our web pages and style them every webpage you have seen on our internet is built with these three languages .\\', \\' amentals now building websites often include a bunch of repetitive tasks this is where front-end frameworks and libraries come in a framework or a library comes with a lot of code that we can reuse in our websites so they help us get the job done faster . A lot of companies these days use one of these popular frameworks like react angular or vue .\\', \\' Git is the most popular tool in this space and is used in more than 70 of software companies . You would probably need two weeks for learning git and again i have a comprehensive course for you so these are the essential skills that every front-end developer must have . These skills vary from one company to another so you can learn these additional skills in the future or on the job .\\', \" We\\'re going to talk about how the web works in this lesson i\\'m going to tell you exactly what happens the moment you type the address of a website into your browser and hit enter . We\\'ll talk about a few important concepts and terms that you need to know as a web developer .\", \" http is a language that clients and servers use to talk to each other over the internet . It\\'s not a programming language it\\'s just a plain textual language for communicating over the web . The browser sends a message to the server and says hey give me the home page of this website this is kind of similar to how you send your friend a text message .\", \\' Every data exchange using the http protocol involves two messages a request and a response . The first message is called an http request and the second is an http response . On the second line we can see the host that is codewithmosh.com and the language that the client can accept in this case english .\\', \\' As the browser is reading this html document that is returned from the server it discovers references to other resources in this document like images fonts and other stuff . For each resource the browser sends a separate request to the server for each resource . The browser constructs what we call a dom or a document object model that represents the object or elements in our html document .\\', \" In the next lesson i\\'m going to show you all of these steps in action [Music] all right let\\'s see http requests and responses in action . The browser sends an http request to the server and receives an http response this http response contains an html document the browser reads that document to construct a document object model and render the page .\", \" By default devtools is docked to the bottom of the screen . We can dock it to the left to the right or undock it as a separate window . We\\'re going to go to the network tab so we can inspect the network traffic to and from google.com .\", \" 45 requests are sent from our browser to google.com as you can see there are totally 45 requests and here\\'s the amount of data transferred over the network so in this case just over 94 kilobytes . atively we can go back to this window and press the refresh button now back to the dev tools .\", \" Below the first request we have a request for downloading a png or an image file here\\'s another request for getting another image . Below that we have the date and time of the response . If we click on the preview tab we can see a preview of the  document that is returned from the server .\", \" The first thing we need to do here is to tell the browser that this is an html5 document so we type a left angle bracket now look at this suggestion list the first item here is doctype or document type let\\'s press enter or tab vs  document type . Next i\\'m going to show you how to create your first html document [Music]\", \" Code generated this piece of code for us so with this line of code we can tell browsers that this is an html5 document . The first element we\\'re going to use is the html element so we type html and then press tab or enter once again vscode generated the code for them so what we have here is called the opening tag .\", \" In this video we\\'re going to show how to create our first web page using the development server that we just installed . We use the head element to give browser information about this page for example here we can use the title element to specify the title of this page that appears in the browser over here so let\\'s save the changes by pressing command and s on mac or ctrl and s .\", \" We can see the title that we just typed my first web page now look at the URL or address of this page . We\\'re going to add elements that would appear on our page so let\\'s say we want to display a tweet what elements do we need here an image and some text elements so we type img short for image .\", \" i\\'m going to use my own image which you can also download right below this video but you can use any image that you want so here\\'s my image which   is right here okay now let\\'s close this window good so where is this image relative to our index.html file it\\'s inside the images folder right .\", \" Images slash mosh.jpg now vs code is suggesting this name so we can press tab to complete the code beautiful now alt is short for alternative text and we use this attribute to give the browser some text to display in case the image cannot be displayed we\\'ll talk about this in more detail in the future so for now i\\'m going to delete this attribute .\", \" i\\'m going to show you how to apply css so our page looks kind of like a real tweet [Music] all right now let\\'s see how we can use css to improve the look and feel of this page . n\\'t look like a tweet because we haven\\'t applied css yet as i told you before we use html to define the structure or the building block of our web pages .\", \" Using the border dash radius property to create a round image we\\'re going to get a softer image . Don\\'t worry about memorizing any of these properties, we\\'ll go over them several times throughout the course in this lesson . Save the changes back in the browser our image looks smaller that\\'s a lot better but look at the edges the edges are so sharp .\", \" The image is so close to the text i want to add some space after the text . ed to the left side so let\\'s set the float property to left this will push the image element to the right side of our text element . That\\'s a lot better now let\\'s make the username bold so we\\'re going to apply a rule to our paragraph element .\", \" Css has a different syntax or a different grammar than html throughout the rest of the course you\\'re going to learn both these languages in detail . Next i\\'m going to show you how to format your code using prettier . i just wanted to let you know that this video you\\'ve been watching is the first hour of my ultimate html and css series .\", \\' After you watch this video if you want to learn more from me you can enroll in the full course which is about 13 hours long and covers everything you need to know to build professional quality websites . The full course includes summary notes exercises a real project a certificate of accomplish and you can add your resume and a 30-day money-back guarantee to get a refund if you are not satisfied .\\', \" Using the prettier plugin with prettier we can format our code in a consistent fashion . This is super important when you\\'re part of a team because different people have different ways of formatting their code . If everyone on the team uses the plugin the code will be consistently formatted so let me show you how to use preview .\", \" We don\\'t want to format our code every time we make a change so we can configure vs code to automatically format the code the moment we save the changes so on the top let\\'s go to the code menu then preferences and settings like here search for format and save here\\'s the setting let\\'s enable this setting .\", \\' Document object model is our document object model so we see the same elements that we created earlier in the course . We have some additional elements that are injected by live server for example we have the script element and two divs . These are purely used by live servers so it automatically reloads our page .\\', \" vtools to play with styles and get the look they want once they figure out the exact styles and their values then they apply them in the code . The last thing we\\'re going to cover is validation so as we write code we may run into problems if you have a typo in our code or don\\'t use the right syntax or grammar .\", \" ndard html validator so we go to validator.w3.org this is a standard markup validation service we have three methods for validating our HTML markup . We can validate by an address if our website is live on our internet but this doesn\\'t work for us . We have two other methods to validate by file upload or by direct input in this case i\\'m going with file upload .\", \" An image element must have an alt attribute to provide a description for our image so if the image cannot be displayed the alternative text will be displayed again we\\'re going to talk about the alt attribute in more detail in the future so back to our code. ibute and set it to en which is short for english now what is next we have an error saying the character encoding was not declared don\\'t worry about this we\\'ll talk about this in the next section .\", \" In this case we have embedded all of our css code inside our HTML markup . e have a different validator so we go to jigsaw.w3.org css validator now you don\\'t have to memorize this address simply go to google and search for css . The next section in the next section we\\'re going to explore  how to use validation validation .\", \" In this section we\\'re going to cover the essential html elements you need to know to build web pages . You will learn all the elements used for displaying text links images lists tables as well as container and structural or semantic elements . i would still encourage you to watch this section thoroughly because a lot of people don\\'t use these elements the right way .\", \" This is a very basic HTML boiler plate . We have a couple of metal elements for giving information about this web page . The first meta element is for defining the character set what is a character set well computers don\\'t understand characters like abc and so on they only understand numbers which are represented in binary format zeros and ones .\", \\' Every web page should have at least these two meta elements but we have additional meta elements . We need this element so our web pages look good on all devices mobiles tablets and desktop computers . The viewport is the visible area of a web page so it is this area over here obviously on a mobile device or on a tablet our viewport .\\', \" These keywords were heavily used for search engine optimization but these days most search engines don\\'t put too much weight on these keywords but we can still use them to define the keywords that represent this page . What we type here will appear on google or other search engines when someone searches for a website for example if we search for apple here\\'s what we get now .\", \" By default browsers display emphasized content in italic but don\\'t assume that whenever you want to display italic content you should use the m element . The m element represents stress emphasis of its content so whenever we want to emphasize some content we can wrap it inside an m element so in this case i\\'m going to move html inside these tags .\", \" ngines extract important content in our documents anything to do with styling should be done in css . In the head section we add the style element and here we define a rule for emphasized content . We can set the color to red and font style to normal now don\\'t worry about memorizing any of these properties .\", \" By default strong elements are displayed as bold but once again we can always change the styling . The strong element represents strong importance seriousness or urgency of its contents conceptually it\\'s kind of similar to the emphasis element so where you should use it really depends on your context on your content now let\\'s save the changes and see what we get .\", \" Headings 1 represents the most important heading and heading 6 represents the least important heading . s probably shift ctrl np so let\\'s select html and then bring up the command palette with this command palette we can execute commands in vs code so here i\\'m going to search for a command called wrap with abbreviation that is the first command in the list .\", \" Every web page should have one and only one h1 element so i\\'m going to remove this line now after we use h1 then we should use h2 then h2 we should not jump to h4 so let\\'s say on this page we\\'re going to have two sections one for html the other for css so my next heading should be h2 and here we can type html obviously below this heading we can have some text .\", \" The better we can represent the structure of our document using html the better search engines can read and understand our content so that\\'s all about text next we\\'re going to talk about displaying special characters in html [Music] Some characters are reserved in html and to display them we have to use a special notation for example .\", \" The browser interpreted this as an html tag this is not what we want . To solve this problem we\\'re going to use html entities . These entities start with an ampersand and end with a semicolon in between these two characters we type a few characters that determine the type of the html entity .\", \" You don\\'t need to memorize any of them in fact you\\'re not going to use 99 of them but in case you\\'re curious let me show you the complete list so on google search for .html entities and on this second link dev.w3.org you can see the complete . list of news entities .\", \" In vs code let\\'s bring up the search panel by pressing command and f on mac or ctrl and f  on windows now we paste this word okay here it is we want to make sure that these two words are always together there is no line breaking between them . Almost every webpage on the internet has links to other pages or websites to create these links we use the anchor element .\", \" the explorer panel let\\'s add a new page called about.html . We\\'re going to create a basic HTML boilerplate remember how to do that we type an exclamation mark and then press tab that\\'s it beautiful now back to index.html here we can use a relative or an absolute URL .\", \" We\\'re currently on the about page which is empty beautiful . Instead of a text we can also use an image element so img tab once again here we can type a relative URL to our target image so i\\'m going to go with images mosh.jpg now save take a look .\", \\' Urls like this kind of look messy they look hard to read in those cases we can use an absolute URL so we start with a forward slash and this represents the root of our website at this level we have access to index.html so this is an absolute url .\\', \" mosh.jpg and for the text i\\'m going to say my photo save take a look so here\\'s our second link click my image is displayed in the browser but what if i want to prompt the user to download it that\\'s very easy we\\'re going to add the download attribute to our anchor element so we type download press enter .\", \\' Css section is below default so we have to scroll down to see what we can do here is on the top we can add a link to the css section so when the user clicks on that they will immediately jump to the  section that is very easy . Css is a fragment or what is called a fragment .\\', \" We\\'re going to use an empty fragment so we just type a pound sign without an identifier and then we say jump to top take a look so here\\'s our link click . Let\\'s see how we can link to external websites so let\\'s add another anchor element to link to google.com .\", \" We want to link to external websites so we can also link to emails so i\\'m going to add an anchor and for mailto colon programming with mosh gmail.com email me . When i click on this link my mail client will open and my email address will be pre-populated take a look .\", \" A link is just an address a URL the location of the target page a hyperlink is the element that the user can click on to navigate to that target page that is the difference between a link and a hyper link . Next we\\'re going to talk about embedding images in a bit more detail for this lesson .\", \" The alt attribute is used to provide textual description of the image . It\\'s not compulsory but is highly recommended for a number of reasons . On mobile devices we want to serve a smaller image and on desktop computers . We\\'ll have a conflict section on this topic later on so let\\'s download the small image .\", \" Alternative text can help search engines read this text and understand what we\\'re providing here and there\\'s one more benefit if this image cannot be loaded for some reason the alternative text is shown . This can also happen if there is a network connectivity issue if the user gets disconnected they can still see alternative text .\", \" In the head section let\\'s add a style element and apply a rule to our image . This rule is applied to all images on the page this is probably not something we want to do in the real world scenario . We want to apply a class to this element and then define rules for that class we\\'ll talk about this in more detail in the future .\", \\' The coffee mug is more round but if i applied the height property it becomes squashed so how can we solve this problem well we have a new property in css called object fit so we can set object fit to one of these values most of the time we use cover so the image covers its containing box .\\', \\' This video is the first hour of my ultimate html and css series .
